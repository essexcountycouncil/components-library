Here you can find all the components and elements that form our component library as well as documentation around consuming or contributing to this library.

You can find us on Github @ https://github.com/essexcountycouncil/components-library and if you need to reach us feel free to leave an issue on github or ping us an email at st@essex.gov.uk.

## Consuming

~~`npm install @essexcountycouncil/components-library`~~ SOON

For the moment we are using [Yalc](https://github.com/whitecolor/yalc) locally. Once you're happy with the components library publish it on your local machine using `yalc publish` and then on the project you want to use the components with you can run `yalc add @essexcountycouncil/components-library` to link the package to your project. From here further updates of the component library can be gotten by running `yalc update` within your project after each `yalc publish` in the component library.

Within your project you can then make use of this package like you would with any other package from npm. So if you want to use the Header component you might do something like:

```jsx
import {Header} from '@essexcountycouncil/components-library';
<Header />
```

As an example of this, check this PR https://github.com/essexcountycouncil/accessibility-manual/pull/2

## Contributing

-   `git clone git@github.com:essexcountycouncil/components-library.git`, clone the repo
-   `cd components-library`, enter the repo
-   `npm i`, install our dependencies
-   `npm run storybook`, start your local storybook
-   Develop within the `lib/` folder. You'll want to create a new folder for your component/element and after doing a basic component, create a story for that component so you can see it within storybook and use that for your building.

For a more thorough writeup see [Contributing: Creating a component + story](/?path=/docs/contributing--page)
