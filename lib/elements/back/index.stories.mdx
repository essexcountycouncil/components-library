## Using the back link

The back link takes users back to the previous page. It should be used for transactional pages, such as an online form.

The back link shouldn't be used instead of <a href="/docs/components-breadcrumbs--breadcrumbs">breadcrumbs</a>

## When to use the back link

The back link should only be used on transactional services or multi-page forms.

## When not to use a back link

Do not use a back link on a content, navigational or topic pages.

The back link should not be used as a replacement for breadcrumbs

## How to use back links

Make sure the text you use describes the action of the link, for example "Back to Contact details". 

The link should take you back to the page you were last on, in the state it was in before they left.

Consider putting the back link in a location that is suitable. Do not surround it in other links or actions. (Needs expanding)

## Accessibility

When placing the back link, consider people who use assistive technologies such as screen readers. 

The text you use should also describe the action of the link. Using "Back" may not be enought to describe the action accurately.
