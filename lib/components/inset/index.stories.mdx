# Inset

Use the inset component to highlight important text on a page.

You can use insets:

- [with a heading](#with-a-heading)
- [without a heading](#without-a-heading)

## With a heading

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Inset"
        args={{
            heading: "There are over 260 grit bins.",
            text: "Use the salt in the grit bins provided by us to clear snow and ice from public roads and pavements. It's illegal and irresponsible to use this salt on your private property and driveways.",
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <Inset {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Without a heading

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Inset without heading"
        args={{
            text: "It can only be completed if you have already been assessed as needing care and support.",
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <Inset {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>


## When to use inset

Use the inset component as visual aid to differentiate an excerpt of text from the body of content. It should contain information that’s useful or important to the user, for example:

- quotes
- facts
- statistics
- pertinent information

## When not to use inset

Insets shouldn’t be used instead of an [alert](?path=/docs/components-alert--info) which should provide very important information for a limited time.
