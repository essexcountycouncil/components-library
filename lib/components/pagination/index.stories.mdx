# Pagination

Use pagination to allow users to navigate between a set of related pages.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Pagination"
        args={{
            prevhref: "/",
            prevtext: "Paying for care and support",
            nexthref: "/",
            nexttext: "Personal budget",
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <Pagination {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

<StaticSource code={
    <Pagination
        prevhref="/"
        prevtext="Paying for care and support"
        nexthref="/"
        nexttext="Personal budget"
    />
} />

## When to use pagination

Use paginationto allow users to navigate between a small group of related pages to help users find related information, for example a group of pages about paying for care and support.

## When not use pagination

Do not use pagination on pages that are not related, this could confuse users.

Do not use pagination on transactional pages or forms.

Consider using buttons or back links instead.

## How to use pagination

Use pagination at the bottom of the page, along with contents at the top of the page just below the title.

Use the left arrow along with the word “Previous” and a link to the previous page. Use the right arrow along with the word “Next” and a link to the next page. Use the smae page titles that are used on the contents.

## Accessibility

The pagination component incorporates the `<nav />` element to show that the links are a type of navigation. This `<nav />` also has the attribute `aria-label` with the value `Pagination`. Screen readers will read out this label to identify what type of navigation it is.
