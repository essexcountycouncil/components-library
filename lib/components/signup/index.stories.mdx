# Signup

Use the signup to allow users to register for notifications. The method used applies to email notifcations, but could be applied to other methoda of communications.

We have 2 types of signup that we use at Essex County Council Website (Essex.gov.uk)

-   the [basic sign up](#basic-sign-up)
-   the [big sign up](#big-sign-up)

## Basic sign up

### When to use sign up

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Basic sign up"
        args={{
            isBig: false,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <Signup {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## Big sign up

### When to use big sign up

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="Big sign up"
        args={{
            isBig: true,
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <Signup {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>

## How to use sign ups

When using sign up it should include a heading that should clearly and concisely tell the user what they are signing up to.

### Accessibility

To ensure sign ups are accessible it is important that the input and label are connected so assisstive technologies can recognise they are connected.

```html
<label for="email"
    >Enter your email address
    <input type="text" id="email" name="email" autocomplete="off" />
</label>
```
