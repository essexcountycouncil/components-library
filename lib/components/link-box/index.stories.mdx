# LinkBox

Link boxes are usually displayed on topic pages and help to signpost users to the most popular or useful content within that section.

<Canvas>
    <Story
        name="LinkBox"
        args={{
            href: "/",
            text: "LinkBox",
            supportingText: "Link box copy explaining what content it contains"
        }}
    >
        {(args) => <LinkBox {...args} />}
    </Story>
</Canvas>
