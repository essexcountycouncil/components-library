# ECC Component Library

A component library for ECC and 3rd parties can use a group of components + elements to ensure consistent styling and branding aswell as keeping a high level of accessibility and test coverage.

We're still building this but as an example of what a component library + storybook could look like within Government:

## Tech

- React
- SCSS

## Install

~~`npm install @essexcountycouncil/components-library`~~ SOON

## Contributing

- `git clone git@github.com:essexcountycouncil/components-library.git`, clone the repo
- `cd components-library`, enter the repo
- `npm i`, install our dependencies
- `npm run storybook`, start your local storybook
- Develop within the `lib/` folder. You'll want to create a new folder for your component/element and after doing a basic component, create a story for that component so you can see it within storybook and use that for your building.
